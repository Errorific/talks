    <h2>Ur/Web - Sean Chalmers</h2>
    <p>Following on from our introduction to dependent types in AGDA, Sean is going to show us around Ur and Ur/Web, a dependently typed langauge and full stack web framework.</p>
    <p>Ur is a programming language in the tradition of ML and Haskell, but featuring a significantly richer type system. Ur is functional, pure, statically typed, and strict. Ur supports a powerful kind of metaprogramming based on row types.</p>
    <p>Ur/Web is Ur plus a special standard library and associated rules for parsing and optimization. Ur/Web supports construction of dynamic web applications backed by SQL databases. The signature of the standard library is such that well-typed Ur/Web programs "don't go wrong" in a very broad sense. Not only do they not crash during particular page generations, but they also may not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Suffer from any kinds of code-injection attacks</li>
      <li>Return invalid HTML</li>
      <li>Contain dead intra-application links</li>
      <li>Have mismatches between HTML forms and the fields expected by their handlers</li>
      <li>Include client-side code that makes incorrect assumptions about the "AJAX"-style services that the remote web server provides</li>
      <li>Attempt invalid SQL queries</li>
      <li>Use improper marshaling or unmarshaling in communication with SQL databases or between browsers and web servers</li>
